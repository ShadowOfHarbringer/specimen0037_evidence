re/ **TokenBridge**, I have explained many times that I never had control of the project, I was simply a participant like the others, none of whom are being persecuted with these grade-school-girl-gossip tactics.

Furthermore, the person who claimed to lose 11 BCH never provided any evidence of it not even when they were incentivized with crypto (left behind by Yumeko) to do so.

I'm not sure why this person is linking to a thread on coinflex as I was never involved in it. In fact, I warned people about the coinflex "bridge" very early.

Where were these people then?

re/ **ABC**, so what? And yes, I left ABC once I saw Grassberg and that he was going to try and shove the IFP down everyone's throats. I was not happy with this approach. My position was the same all along: reconciliation and consensus. Sadly, neither "side" wanted that.

re/ **Vitalik tweet**. He makes a good point, which ShadowofHarbringer exemplifies with his juvenile nonsense!

re/ **mod opinions**

>But there are other activities where his obsessive attention and totally fluid usage of facts is again and again a problem"

So my usage of facts is a problem? What?

>his fractious inability to work with others

I work with others all the time.

>He has demonstrated time and time again to have zero scruples, and is more to a willing to throw people or projects under the bus to profit for himself.

This is absolutely ridiculous. And no evidence nor specifics are presented.

>To allow him to promote himself and his projects on sites or forums you control is to make the same mistakes that lead to BTCâ€™s capture.

This is just ironic. It was censorship that lead to the capture of BTC, not free speech.

>long destructive track record. he fucked with dash, he fucked with bch, he fucked with abc

Says the guy who uses his mod powers to violate group rules and create drama, then bans me so I can no longer reply to his slander.

What does "fucked with" mean here? I have provided enormous value to all 3. [https://georgedonnelly.com/portfolio/](https://georgedonnelly.com/portfolio/). If that is "fucked with", then I wish more people would fuck with me.

>he is addicted to doing damage

I have done no damage! There is no damage evidenced in this "secret dossier", nor is there any scamming evidenced! Barely any is accused.

>he's constantly playing the victim

When I am censored and treated unfairly, people lying about me, mods slandering me and no one stops them, well, yeah, there is an unfair dynamic and it affects my well-being. So I am not going to suck it up and eat the abuse. Not anymore.

>he rarely participates in good faith

Really? My apology? My reaching out individually to bury the hatchet with people (whom in the end ignored me)? My evidenced contributions? Give me a break.

>Dude clearly has psychological issues

In good faith, I shared that I had gone to therapy and I see my vulnerability is now being weaponized against me. This is disgusting and abusive.

>Specimen 0037 failing to deliver promised 1 million users in his flipstarter campaign

Show me where in the [deliverables](https://archive.ph/50X6L) is listed 1 million new users? It's not. It's curious that I am accused of bad faith but then this nonsense is included.

BTW I invited the ecosystem to join with me in a group effort in pursuit of the 1 million new users and almost no one participated. I believe it was just Roger and David who signed up.

>[Lack of Delivery](https://www.bitcoincashsite.com/blog) Report after almost 3 years, \[[Archived](https://archive.is/zaWmP)\]

I delivered it and you linked to a page with a link to the delivery report. [https://www.bitcoincashsite.com/blog/panmoni-flipstarter-final-report](https://www.bitcoincashsite.com/blog/panmoni-flipstarter-final-report)

>Denial and lies about stated Flipstarter goals

A goal is different from the actual deliverables. No one reasonably expected I was going to produce 1 million new BCH users for $62,000 USD, much less in the middle of COVID lockdowns.

**In conclusion:**

I was told by these people I was a scammer but **zero evidence of scamming has been presented in this** "secret dossier".

Therefore the basis for the shadow bans and bans is nonexistent, or nothing more than a **personal vendetta**.

This is the same old recycled nonsense as always. Nothing new nor noteworthy.

It is a shame that BCH has lost so much traction and made so many wrong moves, that this is what we are left with: a bunch of petty anons with unaccountable power who seemingly have no greater priority than to pass around gossip notes and create GitHub repos for them -- rather than for code.

BCH urgently needs more dapps and more builders. This Star Chamber that has assembled is an obstacle to that.
